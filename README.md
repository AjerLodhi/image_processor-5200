Image Processor 
Overview
A comprehensive image processing tool designed as a solo project for CPSC 5200 Software Architecture at Seattle University. This project leverages C# and .NET to provide a robust set of image manipulation features, including flipping, rotating, resizing, and converting images to grayscale. The application is built with a modular architecture, ensuring extensibility and maintainability.

Features:

1) Flip Images: Horizontally and vertically.
2) Rotate Images: Rotate images by any degree.
3) Grayscale Conversion: Convert images to grayscale.
4) Resize Images: Resize images to specified dimensions.
5) Thumbnail Generation: Create thumbnails of images.
6) Rotate Left/Right: Rotate images left or right by 90 degrees.
